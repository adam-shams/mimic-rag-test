sql direct:The 28 valid observations have a heart rate range from 51 bpm (first seen at 2126-08-20 11:00:00) to 74 bpm (first seen at 2126-08-20 05:35:00), with a mean of 59.75 bpm and a median of 57.5 bpm. The 5th and 95th percentiles are 51 and approximately 70.65 bpm, respectively, while the trend shows a delta of 1 
bpm over 24 hours (a slope of 0.04167 bpm per hour). The population standard deviation is about 6.73 bpm and the median absolute deviation is 6.0 bpm. Coverage has 28 observations in 25 distinct hour buckets with a minute bucket proportion of 0.0028 (resulting in âˆ’1 missing slots when computed as 24 minus 
observed hours), and there are no value outliers; however, the sparse flag is true because the minute bucket proportion 0.0028 is below 0.1.
