o3-mini normal:
On 2126-08-20, heart_rate was recorded with 28 observations covering 25 hours and 28 minutes, giving a full day's coverage (prop_day = 1.0). The observed values 
ranged from 51.0 to 74.0, with a central tendency marked by a mean of 59.75 and a median of 57.5, and percentiles at 51.0 (P05) and 70.65 (P95). The trend is 
reflected by a delta_last_first of 1.0 and a slope_per_hr of -0.5454545454545454, while variability measures include a standard deviation of 6.727475646290261 
and a median absolute deviation of 6.0. No outliers were detected, and all flags (sparse, value_out_of_bounds, unit_conflicts, duplicates, no_data, approximate) 
are set to false.

o3-mini hybrid:
On day 2126-08-20, the heart_rate was observed with 28 measurements taken over 25 hours and 28 minutes of observations, representing a full proportional day 
(prop_day = 1.0). The values ranged from 51.0 to 74.0 with a mean of 59.75 and median of 57.5, and the 5th and 95th percentiles were 51.0 and 70.65 respectively.
There is a slight downward trend with a delta_last_first of 1.0 and a slope_per_hr of -0.5454545454545454, while variability is moderate (std = 
6.727475646290261, mad = 6.0), and no outliers were found; the flags confirm there are no unit conflicts, sparsity, duplicate entries, out-of-bounds values, 
missing data, or approximate values.

o3-direct:
On 2126-08-20, 28 valid heart rate observations were recorded with values ranging from 51 to 74 BPM. The average heart rate was 59.75 BPM and the median was 57.5
BPM, with the 5th and 95th percentiles at 51 BPM and 70.65 BPM respectively. The time-ordered data showed a slight increase of 1 BPM over a 24‚Äêhour span (a slope
of about 0.04167 BPM per hour) and a moderate dispersion with a standard deviation of 6.73 BPM and a median absolute deviation of 6.0 BPM. Observations were 
noted in 25 distinct hourly buckets and 28 distinct minute buckets, with no outliers, duplicates, or unit conflicts, and the data is not considered sparse or 
approximate.
